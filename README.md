# Simplified Financial Dashboard with Next.js

Welcome to mine first Next.js project! This repository contains the code for a simplified financial dashboard.

## Features

- **Public Home Page:** A welcoming public home page that provides an overview of the application and its features.
- **Login Page:** A secure login page that authenticates users before granting access to the dashboard.
- **Protected Dashboard Pages:** Dashboard pages that are accessible only to authenticated users, ensuring data privacy and security.
- **Invoice Management:**
  - **Add Invoices:** Users can add new invoices to the dashboard.
  - **Edit Invoices:** Users can edit existing invoices.
  - **Delete Invoices:** Users can delete invoices they no longer need.
- **Database Integration:** While setting up the accompanying database will be covered in a later chapter, the project is designed to work seamlessly with a backend database for storing and managing invoice data.
